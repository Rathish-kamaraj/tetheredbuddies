# GitHub Setup Guide for Tethered Buddies

## üöÄ Publishing Your Game to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "New repository"** (+ icon in top right)
3. **Repository name**: `tethered-buddies` (or your preferred name)
4. **Description**: "A 2D cooperative puzzle platformer with rope physics"
5. **Make it Public** so others can see and play
6. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have files)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Code to GitHub

In your Replit terminal, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to git

git commit -m "Initial commit: Tethered Buddies game with 5 levels"

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tethered-buddies.git

git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Free Web Hosting)

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
5. **The deploy.yml workflow will automatically**:
   - Build your game when you push changes
